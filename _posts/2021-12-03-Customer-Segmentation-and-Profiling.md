title: "Customer Segmentation and Profiling: a managerial approach"
excerpt: "In the last tutorial, we presented how to segment customers databases using hierarchical cluster analysis. The approach is quite simple and does not require any parameters other than the number of clusters we want to obtain. However, in practice, this method is not very efficient, as we have no control over how the clusters are formed.  And what is the point of segmentation, if we do not understand how the segments differ or if we cannot treat each market segment appropriately. In this tutorial, we will develop a non-statistical segmentation also known as managerial segmentation."

## Introduction

One of the most used and familiar concepts in marketing is market segmentation, that is, the division of markets, based on common characteristics, into homogeneous groups of customers, in order to develop segment-specific marketing strategies to effectively capture the target segments. \\ 
The customer characteristics that can be applied to segmentation are widespread in the literature and generally seem to represent minor variations on one of these familiar themes: location, demographics, psychographics and customer buying behavior. In reality, there is no single best method for segmenting a market and, more importantly, the way we segment a market should reflect what we intend to achieve. For simplicity, we will be using in what follows the RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) analysis introduced in the previous tutorial.
