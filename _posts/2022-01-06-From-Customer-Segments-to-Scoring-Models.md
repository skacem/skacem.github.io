title: "From RFM Analysis to Predictive Scoring Models"
excerpt: "From a management perspective, it is extremely useful to see not only the extent to which  customer segments contribute to today's revenue, but also the extent to which each segment today is likely to contribute to next year's revenue. After all, how can you make good plans and strategic decisions for next year, if you can't accurately forecast sales and revenues?
In this tutorial we will learn how to predict customers next year's activities and their monetary value based on RFM Analysis."
