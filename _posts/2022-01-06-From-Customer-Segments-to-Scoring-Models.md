title: "From RFM Analysis to Predictive Scoring Models"
excerpt: "From a managerial perspective, it is extremely useful to determine not only the contribution of customer segments to today's sales, but also the expected contribution of each segment to next year's revenue. After all, how can you develop good plans and make informed strategic decisions for next year if you can't accurately forecast sales and revenues?
In this tutorial, we'll learn how to predict next year's customer activity and dollar value based on RFM analysis."
