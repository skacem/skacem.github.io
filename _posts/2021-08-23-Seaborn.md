excerpt: "Seaborn provides a high-level interface to Matplotlib and is compatible with Pandas’ data structures. Given a pandas DataFrame and a specification of the plot to be created, seaborn automatically converts the data values into visual attributes, internally computes statistical transformations and decorates the plot with informative axis labels and legends. In other words, seaborn saves you all the effort you would normally need to put into creating figures with matplotlib."

## Seaborn and the Python Visualization Landscape

The python visualization landscape is complex and can be overwhelming. How did it get there?  (see [Jake Vanderplas' talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FytuB8nFHPQ) at PyCon 2017)

Yet when it comes to data science and machine learning, Seaborn is the definitive data visualization library.  

Seaborn provides a high-level interface to matplotlib and is compatible with pandas’ data structures. Given a pandas dataframe and a specification of the plot to be created, seaborn automatically converts the data values into visual attributes, internally computes statistical transformations and decorates the plot with informative axis labels and legends.  In other words, seaborn saves you all the work you normally have to do when using matplotlib.  And if you have already used matplotlib, you know how long it sometimes takes to modify even a small part of your plot.

Nevertheless, to take full advantage of both worlds: the high-level API of Seaborn and the deep customizability of matplotlib, it is worthwhile to have some knowledge of the concepts and functions of matplotlib.


## Seaborn vs. Matplotlib

As a motivation, let me first show the aesthetic difference between matplotlib and seaborn with a simple random-walk plot, while using their default  style and colours [1].  
We start by importing the required python libraries. By convention, Seaborn is imported as `sns`.

```python
# imports
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Notebook settings
# Global figure size
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = 9, 4
```

```python
# Create random walk data:
rwlk = np.random.RandomState(123)
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 500)
y = np.cumsum(rwlk.randn(500, 6), 0)
```
```python
# Plot the data with Matplotlib defaults
plt.style.use('classic')
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.legend('ABCDEF', ncol=2, loc='upper left');
```
<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/3/rndwlk_mpl.png" style="zoom:90%;" />
<div class="thecap">   <br> </div></div>

It's remarkable how similar it looks to Matlab. In this respect, Matplotlib has excelled. Not only does it have a Matlab-like interface, but the graphics are also very similar. In my opinion, this is one of the major points that made python so successful today. However, I have to admit that, although the diagrams are complete in terms of information, they are not very visually appealing. 

Let's plot the same data using seaborn with its default settings, to see what I mean.
```python
sns.set()
# same plotting code as above
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.legend('ABCDEF', ncol=2, loc='upper left');
```
<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/3/rndwlk_sns.png" style="zoom:90%;" />
<div class="thecap"> <br> </div></div>

Much better, don't you think so?  
Visuals are increasingly important. Indeed, the audience for data visualizations is also expanding along with the size of data. Data visualizations are now consumed by people from all sorts of professional backgrounds.


## The Artist

Matplotlib’s architecture consists of three tiers: Backend layer, Artist layer and the scripting layer. The Artist hierarchy is the middle layer of the matplotlib stack and it is the place where much of the heavy lifting happens.

<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/3/anatomy.png" style="zoom:90%;" />
<div class="thecap"> Source: matplotlib.org </div></div>

Every single component from the above pictures is an `Artist` instance and can be accessed and modified with matplotlib. Therefore, if you want to learn how to customize your Seaborn charts, the artist is a good place to start.  

As you will see below, the Seaborn diagrams are usually very well designed and do not require any additional fine-tuning of the plots. In fact, you will be most productive if you focus only on Seaborn and leave the design of the artist instances to Seaborn.

However, before we go any further and to better understand how seaborn works, it is important to understand the concepts behind the following classes; also known as containers: Figure, Axes and Axis.

### Figure

This `Artist` object refers to the whole figure that you see. It is possible to have multiple sub-plots (Axes) in the same figure.

```python
# create a figure with 4 axes 
fig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=2)
# Annotate the first subplot
ax[0, 0].annotate('This is an Axes', 
                  (0.5, 0.5), color='r', 
                  weight='bold', ha='center', 
                  va='center', size=14)
# Set the axis of the second axes to x = y = [0, 3]
ax[0, 1].axis([0,3, 0,3])
# Title of the figure
plt.suptitle('One Figure with Four Axes', fontsize=18);
```
<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/3/1f4a.png" style="zoom:100%;" />
<div class="thecap"> <br></div></div>


### Axes
In the previous example, we plotted a `Figure` instance containing four `Axes` instances. `Axes` object refers to the region of the image with the data space. `Figure` can contain multiple Axes, but a given `Axes` can only be in one `Figure`. `Axes` contains two (or three in the case of 3D) `Axis` objects [2].

```python
print(fig.axes)
```
    [<AxesSubplot:>, <AxesSubplot:>, <AxesSubplot:>, <AxesSubplot:>]


### Axis
`Axis` refers to an actual axis (x-axis/y-axis) in a specific `Axes`.

```python
# print the axis of the first axes from the above figure
print(ax[0, 1].axis())
```
    (0.0, 3.0, 0.0, 3.0)

Now that we have reviewed the basics of matplotlib's Artist layer, lets move on to seaborn plotting functions.

## Overview of Seaborn Plotting Functions

In seaborn, each plotting function is either a **Figure-level** function or an **Axes-level** function.  Grasping the difference between both functions is essential.  


### Axes-Level Functions

An Axes-level function makes self-contained plots and has no effect on the rest of the figure. They behave like most plotting functions in the `matplotlib.pyplot` namespace. They plot data onto a single `matplotlib.pyplot.Axes` object. Thus, they can coexist perfectly in an object-oriented matplotlib script.  

The following example illustrates how seaborn axes-level functions and matplotlib plots can coexist together, in the same picture.

```python
# we start by loading our dataset
penguins = sns.load_dataset('penguins')

# Then we create a figure with two axes using matplotlib
fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(8, 4), gridspec_kw=dict(width_ratios=[4, 3]))
# We use sns to generate the scatter plot on the first subplot
sns.scatterplot(data=penguins, x="flipper_length_mm", y="bill_length_mm", hue="species", ax=axs[0])

# Finally, we use matplotlib to create a bar chart on the second subplot
xy = dict(penguins['species'].value_counts())
axs[1].bar(xy.keys(), xy.values(), 
           color=['royalblue','darkseagreen','darkorange']);
```
<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/3/peng1.png" style="zoom:110%;" />
<div class="thecap"> <br> </div></div>

I hope you now have a better understanding of what axis-level functions are and how they co-exist with Matplotlib plots.  
In the [Exploring Seaborn's Common Types of Plots][#id1] section, we will introduce the most important axis plots that every data scientist needs in their toolkit.

### Figure-Level Functions

Figure-level functions, on the other hand, control the entire figure. They create a new figure every time they are invoked and return a `FacetGrid` object that contains one or more subplots. 

Each figure-level function corresponds to several axes-level functions that serve similar purposes.

<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/3/function_overview2.png" style="zoom:75%;" />
<div class="thecap"> Based on: seaborn.pydata.org </div></div>


For example, the `sns.displot()` function is the figure-level function for  kernel density estimates (kde).   
To draw a kde plot, on a figure-level, we do as follows:
```python
# We create a displot figure then we set kind="kde"
sns.displot(data=penguins, x="", hue="species", 
             multiple="stack", kind="kde")
```
<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/3/kde.png" style="zoom:95%;" />
<div class="thecap">  </div></div>

To get such a visually appealing figure with Matplotlib, we need more than just one line of code. However, the most interesting thing about the figure-level functions is not the appearance of the figures, but rather the ability to draw multiple instances of the same plot on different subsets of data. Indeed, they are tailor-made for this use case --More about this in a later section.

## [Exploring Seaborn’s Common Types of Plots](#id1)

Before you read on, you might want to take a look at the Seaborn [gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html). It gives an insight into the different types of plots you can generate with Seaborn. The thing to note is the wide range of plots and especially the beautiful and professional look they have. In fact, when plotting with seaborn, you don't have to do the work twice, by that I mean, the plots you create during your exploratory data analysis could be used to communicate your findings to your stakeholders.  
A key to success in your role as a data scientist is the ability to effectively communicate your findings visually to a variety of audiences. At least in a way that accommodates engineers and their desire for detail, while being understandable and simple for managers and different levels of leadership.

 In this section I will summarize the most basic plots using different data sets. For a more extensive tutorial check [seaborn's official webpage](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html).

### Bar Charts

A bar chart or bar graph is a chart that presents categorical data with rectangular bars with hights or lengths proportional to the values that they represent and iy can be plotted vertically or horizontally.

### Count Plots



The core feature of Seaborn is to provide high-level commands to create, with less boilerplate code, a variety of chart types that are useful for both exploratory as well as explanatory data visualization.
