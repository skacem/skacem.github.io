title: "Customer Clustering using RFM Analysis"
excerpt: "It is impossible to develop a precision marketing strategy without identifying who you want to target. Marketing campaigns tailored to specific customers rely on the ability to categorize those based on their demographic characteristics and buying behavior. Segments should be clearly differentiated from each other according to the maxim: \"Customers are unique, but sometimes similar\".
In this tutorial, we will learn how to segment your customers database using RFM analysis along with the hierarchical cluster analysis we introduced in the previous tutorial."
