title: "Customer Clustering using RFM Analysis"
excerpt: "It is impossible to develop a precision marketing strategy without identifying who you want to target. Marketing campaigns tailored to specific customers rely on the ability to accurately categorize those based on their demographic characteristics and buying behavior. Segments should be clearly differentiated from each other according to the maxim: \"Customers are unique, but sometimes similar\".
In this tutorial, we will learn how to segment your customers database using RFM analysis along with the hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) we introduced in the previous tutorial."

## Introduction

The field of marketing analytics is very broad and can include fascinating topics such as:

* Text mining,
* Social network analysis,
* sentiment analysis,
* realtime bidding and so on.

However, at the heart of marketing lie few basic questions, that often remain unanswered:

1. Who are my customers?
2. Which customers should I target, and spend most of my marketing budget on?
3. What is the future value of my customers?

In this tutorial, we will explore the first two questions using customer segmentation techniques involving RFM analysis along with HCA.

## Customer Segmentation

You can't treat your customers the same way, offer them the same product, charge the same price, or communicate the same benefits. Otherwise you will miss a lot of value. So you need to understand the distinctions in your customers' needs, wants, preferences and behaviors. Only then can you customize your offering, personalize your customer approach, and optimize your marketing campaigns.  

Now, in today's digital world, almost every online retailer holds a massive customer database. So, how do we deal with big customer databases?  
Treating each and every customer individually is very costly. 

A great segmentation is all about finding a good balance between simplifying enough, so it remains usable and not simplifying too much, so it's still statistically and managerially relevant.
