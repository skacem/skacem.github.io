# My blog

My personal GitHub Pages site, built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

If you want to give it a try, just fork it by clicking the "fork" button in the top right.
Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL. Finally set site-wide configuration under `_config.yml`, post your content in `_post` directory and push it to origin.
