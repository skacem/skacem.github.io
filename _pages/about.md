This is my little corner, something Iâ€™ve been wanting to make for a while but never got around to doing. I'm a chronic geek passionate about AI, math, quantitative finance and programming, which should be evident from the information I post here.

This site is made with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. I chose GitHub Pages because it allows me to do everything in Markdown and to blog like a hacker. Most of the code is borrowed from elsewhere and you are welcome to borrow as much as you want or just fork it all from [here](https://github.com/skacem/skacem.github.io).

In the unlikely event that you should want or need to get in touch, please email [skander.kacem@gmail.com](skander.kacem@gmail.com) or tweet something [@skanderkacem](https://twitter.com/SkanderKacem).
